## Introduction
Given a graph <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=G = (N,L)">, let <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=L_k"> be the set of edges connected to a node <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=k"> where <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=k \in N">. The isolation index of the node <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=k"> is given by <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=Q_k">, which is the number of 'inÔ¨Ånite length paths' between any pair of nodes in the graph <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=H = (N,(L-L_k))">. This is equivalent to the number of disconnected pairs of nodes (i.e. there does not exist a path joining one node to another). The intuition behind the Isolation index is the following: it quantifies the inaccessibility in the network when a specific element (node or edges) is disconnected, like in a flooding or construction work. 

____________
## Algorithm's Pseudocode:

```
Isolation_Index(G,v):
    H <- G.disconnect_node(v)
    component_sizes <- Connected_Component(H).sizes
    total <- G.node_count
    isolation_index_v <- 0
    for component_size in component_sizes
           total <- total - component_size
           isolation_index_v <- isolation_index_v + 2*total*component_size
    return isolation_index_v
```

## Example

1. Node of interest is the red color node we will showthe computation of isolation index for it, sameprocess follows for all other nodes.

2. Disconnect the red node gives the resultant graph <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=H">.

3. Identifying the connected components

4. Getting the sizes of the connected components

5. Initially set Isolation index of node to <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=0">. The lines joining 2 components represent the number of disconnected ordered pairs for nodes between them. The diagram shows calculation for the <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=1^{st}">. component <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=C_1">. w.r.t all other components ( This step is shown just for explanation sake in algorithm we directly calculate by the next method )

6. Simplified calculation for <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=1^{st}"> component using the compliment of the component as <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\overline{C_1}"> add the total to the isolation index count. This is where the variable <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=total"> is used for representing the number of nodes in the compliment component for each component as we progress to calculate the isolation index

7. Moving on to the contributions from the next component, hence removing the <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=1^{st}"> component as it's contribution is already taken into account. Repeat this process ( from 5/6 )  for all other components and adding the contribution from each component gives the Isolation index.
